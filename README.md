# Uncommon CSS Background Image Error

This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS bug related to background images not displaying as expected.  The problem stems from an incorrect or missing path to the background image. The solution involves carefully checking and correcting the image path.

## Bug Description

A CSS rule attempts to set a background image using the `background-image` property. However, the image fails to load because of a problem with the specified path to the image file.
