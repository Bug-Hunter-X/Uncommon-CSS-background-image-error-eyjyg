The solution to this problem is to double-check and correct the image path within the CSS rule.  The corrected code is shown below.  It's vital that the path is correct relative to the location of the CSS file. If the image is in the same directory, use a relative path like this.  If not adjust the path accordingly.  Additionally verify the image file exists and that the file type is one that the browser supports.  
```css
.my-element {
  background-image: url('./images/background.jpg'); /* Corrected path */
}
```
