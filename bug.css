The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error where the expected background image doesn't appear due to a missing or incorrect path.  The path might be wrong relative to the CSS file, the image might not exist, or the image file type might be unsupported. 
```css
.my-element {
  background-image: url(images/background.jpg);
}
```
